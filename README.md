## About 

We are Paredes Aleman Architects a Guatemalan company how decided to help the people affected by the tragedy of the Fuego volcano. We thought about how we could support our country, even with a grain of sand. When observing the authorized shelters we saw that one of the problems that exist is the lack of suitable cradles for very small children who sadly were left homeless or who had to be evacuated. Immediately we started working on the design of that first space that a human being occupies, that could be manufactured quickly, that was easy to build, and that could also be effectively transportable.


With this objective we have been working in a special design to develop the "Temporary Emergency Cots and Short Assembly", and we decided to name them with the acronym CEmTECb ( "Cunas de Emergencia Temporal y Ensamblaje Corto" ). 


We have also decided to put the digital manufacturing file on the internet with a Creative Commons license (CC BY-NC-SA 4.0) of international non-commercial attribution. This means that any person anywhere in the world can have access to download the file, copy it, redistribute it or modify it without any cost, being prohibited the use of the material for commercial purposes. This is so that in a natural disaster any person or entity has free access to the file so that they can digitally manufacture their own CEmTEC cribs with a CNC machine or laser cutter (using a Fab Lab for example). We will also make available the dimensioned plans if you want to manufacture with conventional analog tools.


## Features

- Is made by only 8 pieces, cut with CNC machine in a total time of 90 minutes per cradle.
- It easily assembles under pressure between people in a total time of 90 seconds, and can be transported by a person using the side controls.
- You have the option of reinforcing the pieces between the "thread-seeking" screws at the specific points indicated on each piece.
- For its manufacture, only one sheet and 5/8 MDF or similar material is needed for each cradle, maximizing the use and minimizing waste.
- All the pieces are symmetrical to avoid confusion in the assembly.
- The side panels consist of five vertical slots in order to have visual access to the child, and at the same time minimize the use of the tool to reduce the cost of its production.
- The slots are vertical and have a safety opening so they do not fit the head of a child.
- All corners and edges are rounded to avoid injury and the infant's clothing does not get stuck.
- The CEmTEC crib includes a 4-inch mattress, a safe height between the top of the mattress and the top of the railings.
- The disassembled pieces can be transported occupying a small volume of 1 m X 0.6 m X 0.08 cms per cradle, thus being able to maximize loading spaces in cars, trucks or containers.
